These Windows-only helpers install the Visual Studio toolchain; they are not used for Linux or other shell scripts.

1. **Console installer (`install_build_tools.bat`)**
   - Runs unattended to fetch Visual Studio 2022 build tools, CMake, and Ninja, then opens a Developer Command Prompt.

2. **PowerShell wrappers (`almondshell_install_build_tools.ps1` / `almondshell_install_gui.ps1`)**
   - Provide the same automation as the batch file, with optional elevation for GUI installs if the stock console run fails.

3. **After installing**
   - Open a new Developer Command Prompt from the Start menu and run your normal `cmake` presets there.
   - If you switch between MSVC and clang-cl, wipe the `build/` directory first so stale artifacts do not leak across compilers.
