# AlmondShell Engine Analysis

## Architecture Highlights
- **Configurable Runtime Flags** – `include/aengineconfig.hpp` centralises renderer and context toggles (SDL, Raylib, OpenGL, software renderer) alongside headless/WinMain entry-point switches, making it the primary control surface for build-time composition.
- **Versioned Core** – `include/aversion.hpp` exposes inline getters for the semantic version components, enabling compile-time inspection of the running revision.
- **Context Management** – `src/acontext.cpp` and `include/acontextmultiplexer.hpp` orchestrate the per-backend render contexts and their window lifecycles, while `include/acontextwindow.hpp` encapsulates platform window data.
- **Hot-Reload Pipeline** – `src/ascriptingsystem.cpp` drives compilation and loading of `.ascript.cpp` files via the task graph scheduler, handing control to `ScriptScheduler` nodes created in `include/ascriptingsystem.hpp`.

## Observed Gaps
- **Fragile Script Loading** – Before this update, missing script sources or compilation artefacts would silently cascade into load failures. The scripting system now validates inputs and outputs before attempting to load DLLs.
- **Roadmap Traceability** – The existing `roadmap.txt` lacked granular prompts or acceptance checks per phase, making automation hand-offs hard to script.
- **Testing Surface** – No automated smoke tests or CI hooks are defined for the critical updater and renderer paths, leaving regression risk high during phase transitions.

## Recommended Focus Areas
1. **Build & CI Hardening** – Introduce cross-platform CMake presets and GitHub Actions to execute `updater` builds plus smoke runs with each PR.
2. **Renderer Regression Harness** – Build headless validation scenes that render deterministic atlas frames for OpenGL, Raylib, SDL, and the software backend.
3. **Task Scheduler Profiling** – Instrument `include/aenginesystems.hpp` and the scheduler loop to trace coroutine stalls, especially during reload storms.
4. **Documentation Automation** – Generate API references from headers and surface them via GitHub Pages to reduce onboarding friction.
