# AlmondShell Engine Analysis

## Architecture Highlights
- **Configurable Runtime Flags** – `include/aengineconfig.hpp` centralises renderer and context toggles (SDL, Raylib, OpenGL, software renderer) alongside headless/WinMain entry-point switches, making it the primary control surface for build-time composition.
- **Versioned Core** – `include/aversion.hpp` exposes inline getters for the semantic version components, enabling compile-time inspection of the running revision.
- **Context Management** – `src/acontext.cpp` and `include/acontextmultiplexer.hpp` orchestrate the per-backend render contexts and their window lifecycles, while `include/acontextwindow.hpp` encapsulates platform window data.
- **Hot-Reload Pipeline** – `src/ascriptingsystem.cpp` drives compilation and loading of `.ascript.cpp` files via the task graph scheduler, handing control to `ScriptScheduler` nodes created in `include/ascriptingsystem.hpp`.

## Observed Gaps
- **Fragile Script Loading** – Before this update, missing script sources or compilation artefacts would silently cascade into load failures. The scripting system now validates inputs and outputs before attempting to load DLLs.
- **Roadmap Traceability** – The existing `roadmap.txt` lacked granular prompts or acceptance checks per phase, making automation hand-offs hard to script.
- **Testing Surface** – No automated smoke tests or CI hooks are defined for the critical updater and renderer paths, leaving regression risk high during phase transitions.

## Recent Progress (v0.59.1)
- The Raylib backend now coalesces OS-driven resize events and forwards them through guarded callbacks, keeping context dimensions and client hooks in sync with the window manager.

## Recent Progress (v0.59.0)
- The Win32-specific multi-context manager is now compiled only on Windows, and a portable stub keeps non-Windows builds linking while the docked UI remains a platform-specific feature.
- `awindowdata.hpp` no longer drags in `<windows.h>` on every platform, replacing the raw handle types with lightweight aliases so headless tools and POSIX builds stop failing during preprocessing.

## Recent Progress (v0.58.3)
- `RunEngine()` now launches the same multi-context render loop that powers `wWinMain`, letting non-Windows entry points exercise
  the full renderer/task orchestration stack without stubbing out the runtime.
- The Win32 bootstrap delegates to a shared helper so there is a single source of truth for context startup, menu routing, and
  scene lifecycle management.

## Recent Progress (v0.58.2)
- Version helpers now use thread-local buffers and expose string views, making it safe to query build metadata from concurrent tools.
- Updater configuration derives its semantic version directly from the version helpers, eliminating manual sync errors.
- Added `docs/aengineconfig_flags.md` to catalogue supported engine configuration switches for multi-backend builds.

## Recent Progress (v0.58.0)
- Added `ScriptLoadReport` to expose per-stage reload diagnostics, capture failure reasons, and emit success flags for automation to consume.
- Task graph workers now destroy coroutine frames after execution and prune completed nodes, preventing latent reload handles from accumulating between runs.
- Script reload orchestration awaits completion synchronously, guaranteeing that editors and tooling observe a consistent state before proceeding.

## Recommended Focus Areas
1. **Build & CI Hardening** – Introduce cross-platform CMake presets and GitHub Actions to execute `updater` builds plus smoke runs with each PR.
2. **Renderer Regression Harness** – Build headless validation scenes that render deterministic atlas frames for OpenGL, Raylib, SDL, and the software backend.
3. **Task Scheduler Profiling** – Instrument `include/aenginesystems.hpp` and the scheduler loop to trace coroutine stalls, especially during reload storms.
4. **Documentation Automation** – Generate API references from headers and surface them via GitHub Pages to reduce onboarding friction.
