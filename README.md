# AlmondShell

Almond Shell is a **Software Engine** written in modern **C++20**, serving as the foundation layer for the evolving AlmondEngine project.
It substitutes AlmondEngines Vulkan and DirectX with 2D graphics back end contexts, 
entire game engines like SDL3, SFML, and even Raylib live inside of AlmondShell and AlmondEngine. In a Multi-Threaded, Multi-Context environment.
It provides a hot-reloadable runtime, a self-updating launcher, and the low-level systems that power rendering, scripting, task scheduling, and asset pipelines.  
The engine runtime drives editor scripts from `src/scripts/`.

- **End users** can download the prebuilt binary, place it in an empty directory, and let it populate the latest AlmondShell files automatically.

---

## Key Features

- 🔄 **Self-updating launcher**  
  Designed to automatically fetch the newest release when run, ensuring users always stay up to date.  
  Can also be built directly from source for full control.  
  *(Currently disabled while under active development.)*  

- ⚙️ **Modular C++20 engine**  
  Built in a **functional, header-only style** with static linkage.  
  Context-driven architecture with systems for rendering, windowing, input, scripting, tasks, and asset management.  

- 🧪 **Live script reloading**  
  Changes to `*.ascript.cpp` files are detected at runtime, recompiled with LLVM/Clang, and seamlessly reloaded.  

- 🗂️ **Well-organised codebase**  
  - Headers in `include/`  
  - Implementation in `src/`  
  - Helper scripts under `unix/` plus project-level `.sh` helpers  

- 🖼️ **Sprite & atlas management**  
  Global registries, unique atlas indexing, and atlas-driven GUI (buttons, highlights, and menus).  

- 🖥️ **Multi-context rendering**  
  Pluggable backends: OpenGL, Raylib, SFML, and a software renderer — switchable via thunks and lambdas.  
  **Multithreaded** with a state-of-the-art **hybrid coroutine + threaded design** for maximum scalability and efficiency.

## Status

✅ **Actively Developed**  
AlmondShell is under **active development** as the software engine base of AlmondEngine.  
It continues to evolve as the **core foundation layer**, ensuring speed, modularity, and cross-platform compatibility with a **static, header-only functional design**.

## Prerequisites

To build AlmondShell from source you will need the following tools:

| Requirement            | Notes |
| ---------------------- | ----- |
| A C++20 toolchain      | Visual Studio 2022, clang, or GCC 11+ are recommended. |
| CMake ≥ 3.10           | Used to generate build files. |
| Ninja _or_ MSBuild     | Pick the generator that matches your platform. |
| Git                    | Required for cloning the repository and fetching dependencies. |
| [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) | Simplifies acquiring third-party libraries listed in `AlmondShell/vcpkg.json`. |
| Optional: Vulkan SDK   | Needed when working on Vulkan backends listed in `include/avulkan*`. |

### vcpkg manifest dependencies

AlmondShell ships with a [vcpkg manifest](AlmondShell/vcpkg.json) so that CMake can automatically fetch all required third-party
packages when you configure the project in manifest mode (`VCPKG_FEATURE_FLAGS=manifests`). The manifest currently pulls in:

- [`asio`](https://think-async.com/) – Asynchronous networking primitives used by the updater and runtime services.
- [`fmt`](https://fmt.dev/) – Type-safe, fast formatting for logging and diagnostics.
- [`glad`](https://glad.dav1d.de/) – OpenGL function loader used by the OpenGL backend.
- [`glm`](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) – Mathematics library for vector and matrix operations.
- [`opengl`](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/) – OpenGL utility components supplied by vcpkg.
- [`raylib`](https://www.raylib.com/) – Optional renderer and tooling integrations.
- [`sfml`](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) – Additional windowing and multimedia support.
- [`sdl3`](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) and [`sdl3-image`](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image) – Cross-platform window,
  input, and image loading.
- [`zlib`](https://zlib.net/) – Compression support for packaged assets and downloads.

If you are using a classic (non-manifest) vcpkg workflow, install the same packages manually before configuring CMake, for example:

```bash
vcpkg install asio fmt glad glm opengl raylib sfml sdl3 sdl3-image zlib
```

When CMake is configured with vcpkg integration enabled, the dependencies will be restored automatically on subsequent builds.

## Building from Source

Clone the repository and configure the build with your preferred toolchain:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Autodidac/AlmondShell.git
cd AlmondShell
```

### Windows (MSVC)

```powershell
cmake -B build -S . -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
cmake --build build --config Release
```

### Linux & macOS (Clang/GCC + Ninja)

```bash
cmake -B build -S . -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```

Both configurations produce the `updater` executable inside the `build` directory. Adjust `--config` or the generator settings to create Debug builds when needed.

---

## Running the Updater & Engine

### Using a Release Binary
1. Create an empty working directory.
2. Download the appropriate `almondshell` binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/Autodidac/AlmondShell/releases) page.

### Running From Source

On launch the updater:
1. Reads the remote configuration targets defined in `include/aupdateconfig.hpp` (for example the `include/config.hpp` manifest in the release repository).
2. Downloads and applies updates when available.
3. Starts the engine runtime, which in turn loads `src/scripts/editor_launcher.ascript.cpp` and watches for changes. Editing the script triggers automatic recompilation within the running session.

Stop the session with `Ctrl+C` or by closing the console window.

---

## Development Tips

- The hot-reload loop in `src/main.cpp` monitors script timestamps roughly every 200 ms. Keep editor builds incremental to benefit from the fast feedback.
- Utility shell scripts (`build.sh`, `run.sh`, `unix/*.sh`) can streamline development on POSIX systems.
- Check the `docs/` folder for platform-specific setup guides, tool recommendations, and dependency notes.
