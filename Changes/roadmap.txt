AlmondShell Completion Roadmap Prompt
====================================

Objective
---------
Create a production-ready release of the AlmondShell runtime that can bootstrap AlmondEngine end-to-end across supported platforms.

Guiding Principles
------------------
1. Preserve the engine's static, header-first architecture.
2. Prioritise developer ergonomics: fast iteration, self-diagnosing tooling, and rich documentation.
3. Maintain deterministic builds with reproducible dependency management via vcpkg and CMake.

Execution Plan
--------------
Use the following phases as a step-by-step prompt for future automation or assistant runs. Each phase is framed as a checklist that an assistant can execute sequentially.

Phase 1 – Repository Audit & Build Health
----------------------------------------
**Goal:** establish deterministic builds across platforms.
- [ ] Clone repo, install prerequisites (CMake, Ninja/MSVC, vcpkg).
- [ ] Configure CI-compatible build presets for Windows, Linux, macOS (`CMakePresets.json`).
- [ ] Restore vcpkg dependencies in manifest mode and cache the install tree.
- [ ] Build `updater` target in Debug and Release on all platforms; capture build logs.
- [ ] Create a smoke test harness that launches the updater, exercises script reload, and swaps renderers headlessly.

Phase 2 – Core Runtime Stabilisation
------------------------------------
**Goal:** make the runtime resilient to reload, resize, and multi-context stress.
- [x] Review `include/aengineconfig.hpp` flags; document supported combinations in `/AlmondShell/docs`. *(v0.58.2 adds `docs/aengineconfig_flags.md` covering supported renderer/context mixes.)*
- [ ] Implement regression tests for each renderer backend (OpenGL, Raylib, SDL software) using headless validation scenes.
- [x] Harden multi-context window management with assertions, telemetry counters, and leak detection hooks in `acontextmultiplexer`. *(v0.57.16 prevents the main thread from re-entering active render threads, removing a long-standing race in `ProcessAllContexts`; v0.59.0 gates the Win32-only multiplexer implementation and provides cross-platform stubs so Linux/macOS builds stop failing.)*
- [x] Cache per-window narrow titles so SDL and Raylib initialisers can resolve their pane labels without relying on loop-local state. *(v0.59.3 persists the `narrowTitle` metadata in the multiplexer before backend initialisation, repairing the Windows build.)*
- [x] Route both the automatic `RunEngine()` entry point and `wWinMain` through the same multi-context loop so every startup path spins up the full renderer/task orchestration stack.
- [x] Fix Raylib resize propagation so OS-driven window changes update context dimensions and client callbacks without recursion. *(v0.59.1 coalesces Raylib resize notifications and forwards them through guarded callbacks.)*
- [ ] Finalise task scheduler/coroutine orchestration; stress-test script reload storms and fix deadlocks.
- [x] Optimise hot-reload pipeline to recompile scripts incrementally with clear diagnostics (see `src/ascriptingsystem.cpp`). *(v0.58.0 introduces `ScriptLoadReport`, synchronous reload waits, and task pruning to surface failures deterministically.)*
- [ ] Integrate automated smoke coverage for the script reload flow using the new diagnostics surface.

Phase 3 – Feature Completion
----------------------------
**Goal:** ship feature parity with the planned AlmondEngine hand-off.
- [ ] Ship the asset pipeline tooling for atlases, shaders, and script packaging with CLI entry points.
- [ ] Flesh out networking: Steam backend primary, ASIO fallback with reconnect/backoff logic surfaced in telemetry.
- [ ] Implement cross-backend input abstraction with remapping profiles and virtual device support.
- [ ] Provide a metrics overlay (frame time, job queue depth, memory usage) toggled via scripting API.
- [ ] Integrate save/load checkpoints into the scene framework for each bundled mini-game.

Phase 4 – Tooling & Automation
------------------------------
**Goal:** enable one-click workflows and CI coverage.
- [ ] Add `scripts/` commands for build, test, package, and release flows (POSIX + PowerShell).
- [ ] Create editor automation templates under `src/scripts/` demonstrating UI bootstrapping for future editor work.
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions/CI pipelines for build + test + artifact upload (matrix across supported OS/toolchains).
- [ ] Generate API documentation from headers (Doxygen/Sphinx) and publish via GitHub Pages.
- [ ] Implement crash reporting with symbol upload and minidump collection.

Phase 5 – Documentation & Release Readiness
-------------------------------------------
**Goal:** prepare the release and onboarding collateral.
- [ ] Update README with latest setup steps, feature matrix, and platform support table.
- [ ] Write migration guide for integrators upgrading from prior snapshots.
- [ ] Produce quickstart tutorials (text + video) using example projects.
- [ ] Draft release notes summarising new features, known issues, and roadmap alignment.
- [ ] Run a final release candidate dry run: build, package, sign, and verify checksums.

Acceptance Criteria
-------------------
- All build targets succeed on supported platforms with automated verification.
- Regression test suite covers rendering, scripting, networking, and updater flows.
- Documentation enables new contributors to build, extend, and deploy the engine within one working day.
- Release artifacts are reproducible, signed, and accompanied by validated checksums.

Next Steps Prompt
