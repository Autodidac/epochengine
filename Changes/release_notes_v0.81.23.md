# AlmondShell v0.81.23 Release Notes

- Bumped the engine version constants so runtime banners, tooling, and documentation agree on v0.81.23.
- Refreshed the README snapshot, engine analysis notes, and configuration guide changelog to advertise the v0.81.23 tag.
- Synced the changelog entry with the new release metadata for consistent snapshot reporting.
- Documented the C++23 module-first baseline so tooling and packagers can align module scanning, BMI generation, and compiler flags.
