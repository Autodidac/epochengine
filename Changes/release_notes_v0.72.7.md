# AlmondShell v0.72.7 Release Notes

- Added module partitions for the command queue, updater system, diagnostics, binding/handle helpers, and menu overlay so consumers can import the `aengine.*` surfaces directly without relying on legacy headers.
- Updated the README snapshot, module mapping guide, engine analysis, and configuration flag notes to document the expanded module coverage and keep metadata aligned with the v0.72.7 release tag.
